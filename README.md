# VS Code as FS

> Heavily inspired by [TabFS](https://github.com/osnr/TabFS).

{WIP} Mounts VS Code states as files to be processed by other tools.

## Configration

This extension is disabled by default. To enable it on your project, add this item to your `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "as-fs.enabled": true
}
```

The files mapping to your editor states will be saved under `.vscode/.as-fs/` by default. You can change it by this config:

```json
{
  "as-fs.path": ".vscode/.as-fs"
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ You may also want to add `.as-fs` to your `gitignore`

## Avaliable Modules

| ID | Enabled by default | Descriptions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `current-tab` | Yes | Map current opened tab's filepath to `current-tab/path` |
| `current-selections` | No | Map current editor selections `current-tab/selections.json` |

> More to come, or open a feature request.

Modules can be controlled by

```json
{
  "as-fs.modules": [
    "current-tab",
    "current-selections"
  ]
}
```
